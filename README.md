# App full stack for Axie Gov Data Hackathon

## The Mission
Track 1: Treasury Inflows and Outflows
Create a comprehensive visualization of our treasury's inflows and outflows. This includes:

Inflows: Breeding fees, R&C minting fees, marketplace fees, ascension fees, minting fees, and evolution fees

Outflows: Hack recovery funds (demonstrating the link between ETH in the treasury and the bridge) and treasury fund distributions

Provide both daily and weekly views to capture trends

----------------------------------------------------------
Track 2: ETH Accumulation Tracker
Develop a system to track and display ETH accumulation in the treasury since March 29, 2022. This will offer a clear picture of our growing digital assets over time.

For the most impact, we encourage participants to do both tracks and include interactive elements like plots and dashboards
